[WebVR: Adding VR to Your Web Sites and Web Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7iY0WqVqwM)


WebVR has now shipped with browsers including Microsoft Edge, Chrome, and Firefox, enabling you to build immersive experience directly in the browser. We show you how to build a WebGL VR experience working in the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Mobile Cardboard and the new Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Coupled with Progressive Web App (PWA) principles, those web apps could really compete with native apps.
